    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>LocalLoop is a community-driven guide to the small, often overlooked places that make cities worth living in. We're not a review app or a booking platform — we're a curated collection of spots that locals actually love.</p>
    <p>We started in Boston in 2023 with a simple Google Doc shared between friends. That doc became a newsletter, and the newsletter became LocalLoop. Today we cover three cities, have a small volunteer team of city writers, and are still just as excited about finding a great latte as we were on day one.</p>

    <h2>How We Choose Places</h2>
    <p>Every spot on LocalLoop is visited in person before it's listed. We don't accept paid placements, we don't use affiliate links, and we don't list anything just because it's popular. If it's on LocalLoop, someone on our team genuinely liked it.</p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Community first:</strong> We highlight small, independent businesses over chains.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest curation:</strong> No sponsored content. Ever.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We note transit access and wheelchair accessibility where known.</li>
      <li><strong>Local knowledge:</strong> Our writers are residents, not tourists.</li>
    </ul>
